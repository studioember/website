Philosophy Bills io is a finance planning app focused on two core concepts, ‚Äúhow much am I spending per month?‚Äù &amp;amp; ‚Äúfrom which account am I paying each bill?‚Äù. Bills io was created to answer both of those questions.</description></item><item><title>Bills io, the origin</title><link>https://studioember.com/posts/blog/origin-bills-io/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://studioember.com/posts/blog/origin-bills-io/</guid><description>The idea for Bills io first originated in late 2019 as a way to put an end to my tireless switching of various productivity apps. Prior to creating this app, I used to use apps like Reminders, Todoist, Things, Numbers, etc. to try and create a system for remembering which bills to pay and when. In this process, I was able to create a system, but no app fit that payment flow.</description></item><item><title>Changelog &amp; Updates</title><link>https://studioember.com/billsio/changelog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://studioember.com/billsio/changelog/</guid><description>Ongoing list of updates and changes to Bills io.

Overall, it was a typical hardware announcement event. I was impressed with how many colors they added to the new iMac. The interesting fact that the M1 processor remained the M1 and didn&amp;rsquo;t increment yet for the iMac means we will be waiting for M2 with the Pro devices.
Speaking of Pro, the iPad Pro update was simultaneously bland yet the most interesting read after the fact.</description></item><item><title>Public SSH Keys Page</title><link>https://studioember.com/posts/blog/public-ssh-keys/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://studioember.com/posts/blog/public-ssh-keys/</guid><description>tldr;
curl https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.keys &amp;gt;&amp;gt; $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys When working on server or connecting to remote hosts, having ssh access is vital. It took me by surprise that GitHub and GitLab both host these pages for public ssh keys. This makes it super easy to access for times when you cannot paste into a remote server.
I also use this to add keys for co-workers or sending the above tldr; to a client to add my keys.</description></item><item><title>Creating this Blog via Hugo</title><link>https://studioember.com/posts/blog/new-blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://studioember.com/posts/blog/new-blog/</guid><description>When starting a new project, picking the right frameworks and stack can make further development a lot more pleasant for your future self. Thinking about how I wanted to develop this blog was not an easy task. My first instinct was to purchase a monthly subscription to Ghost Blog. At the time, the lowest subscription was about $30 / month billed annually. For a casual blog with no revenue, this was way too expensive.</description></item><item><title>Welcome</title><link>https://studioember.com/posts/welcome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://studioember.com/posts/welcome/</guid><description>Thanks for visiting StudioEmber.

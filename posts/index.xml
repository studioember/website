I do, and started to collect a few without a destination or time to set up a use. Some of these domains had secure only top level domains (.dev &amp; .app specifically). I wanted to set a couple of these domains to redirect here, <a href="https://studioember.com">studioember.com</a>. Unfortunately, <a href="https://hover.com">Hover</a> only allows redirects for regular domains that support http connections, basically anything besides the TLD&rsquo;s I have.</p>
<h2 id="github-pages">GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>I will quickly go over the first step in this process, setting up a standard GitHub Page with a custom domain. At the time of writing, GitHub has a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">great tutorial</a> that specifies these domain records:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Host</th>
<th>Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>CNAME</td>
<td>@</td>
<td>GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CNAME</td>
<td>WWW</td>
<td>GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td>@</td>
<td>185.199.108.153</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td>@</td>
<td>185.199.109.153</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td>@</td>
<td>185.199.110.153</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td>@</td>
<td>185.199.111.153</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Then, in your redirect project, create a CNAME file with the custom domain. See the <a href="https://github.com/overtfuture/profile/blob/b47efc04f840a9198227b308463d2a23185024af/CNAME">CNAME file</a> in my <a href="https://github.com/overtfuture/profile">profile redirect repository</a> for an example.</p>
<p>file: <code>CNAME</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-plaintext" data-lang="plaintext"><span style="display:flex;"><span>nathangrey.dev
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once you have a pages site published, DNS resolving, and everything is green in the repository settings, you can set up the redirects.</p>
<p><img src="assets/github_pages_complete.png" alt="github pages settings"></p>
<h2 id="redirecting">Redirecting</h2>
<p>By default GitHub pages uses Jekyll for a frontend. This redirect setup uses the standard Jekyll markdown files and includes a simple plugin to handle the redirects.</p>
<p>Below is the full basic setup for a root redirect</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/overtfuture/profile/blob/fe83b26b3f17b9ee76c57465e70cc5addae93089/_config.yml">file</a> <code>_config.yml</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ff79c6">theme</span>: jekyll-theme-cayman <span style="color:#6272a4"># any theme is fine</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ff79c6">plugins</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  - jekyll-redirect-from   <span style="color:#6272a4"># Relevant plugin</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><a href="https://github.com/overtfuture/profile/blob/fe83b26b3f17b9ee76c57465e70cc5addae93089/index.md">file</a> <code>index.md</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-md" data-lang="md"><span style="display:flex;"><span>---
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>title: Studio Ember
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>redirect_to: https://studioember.com
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>---
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This setup gives the bare minimum to redirect a root domain to another url. To add other paths or a fallback for all paths, add the explicit path as a markdown file and a <code>404.md</code> file. For instance, on my profile site, I set up a redirect to Linkedin with a simple file.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/overtfuture/profile/blob/fe83b26b3f17b9ee76c57465e70cc5addae93089/linkedin.md">file</a> <code>linkedin.md</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-md" data-lang="md"><span style="display:flex;"><span>---
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>title: My LinkedIn Profile
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>redirect_to: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathangrey/
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>---
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This file takes the path from <a href="nathangrey.dev/linkedin">nathangrey.dev/linkedin</a> and resolves to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathangrey/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathangrey/</a>. Super simple, but a quick way to have a portfolio type link to hand out and be able to change the destination after the fact.</p>
<p>Hope this helps, and the full repository can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/overtfuture/profile/tree/v1.0.0">GitHub profile repository</a>.</p>

Prior to creating this app, I used to use apps like Reminders, Todoist, Things, Numbers, etc. to try and create a system for remembering which bills to pay and when. In this process, I was able to create a system, but no app fit that payment flow.</description><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The idea for <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjLrpzg_6r0AhUymnIEHfzMBXUQFnoECBsQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fbills-io-track-your-expenses%2Fid1499730119&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qqFXmvp1JdMuBBHaREH47">Bills io</a> first originated in late 2019 as a way to put an end to my tireless switching of various productivity apps. Prior to creating this app, I used to use apps like <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205890">Reminders</a>, <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>, <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/numbers/">Numbers</a>, etc. to try and create a system for remembering which bills to pay and when. In this process, I was able to create a system, but no app fit that payment flow. I decided that I had enough with the other apps, and I wanted an app that was dedicated to managing bills. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjLrpzg_6r0AhUymnIEHfzMBXUQFnoECBsQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fbills-io-track-your-expenses%2Fid1499730119&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qqFXmvp1JdMuBBHaREH47">Bills io</a> was formed.</p>
<p>The system that made it into the app took a few days of planning in a massive Numbers spreadsheet compiling every single expense I had and where it came from. I wanted to replicate the flow of money from the payee to the bill&rsquo;s payment portal. Many apps have tracking expenses down, but I wanted more. I wanted to know how much my rotating credit card balance would be every month because all my subscriptions are on that card. Managing recurring expenses was my primary focus from the beginning and continues to be a core component in the app.</p>
<p>Keeping a predictable and logical flow for managing finances is not easy. Everyone has different bills, and they probably have various methods of managing them. I wanted to have <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjLrpzg_6r0AhUymnIEHfzMBXUQFnoECBsQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fbills-io-track-your-expenses%2Fid1499730119&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qqFXmvp1JdMuBBHaREH47">Bills io</a> fill in the gap between an overly rigid budget system (<a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/nerdwallet-budget-calculator">50 - 30 - 20 rule</a> for example) that tracks every single expense and an overly simplified one that just accounts for a list of bills in a month (think putting bills in the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205890">Reminders</a> app). My financial strategy is to have all my bills organized into lists based on accounts and to have a running counter of how much per month I owe in expenses (always a good number to know). This is basically the hybrid system I created for the app. I didn&rsquo;t want to bog down a new user with heavy financial management tools, but at the same time, wanted to guide them into the system I use every month. If they don&rsquo;t like the core idea, that is fine, everyone is different. There are other apps or services that might fit their need, but I don&rsquo;t want to break the core system that is used. Instead, I hope to grow and evolve it with more and more features down the road.</p>
<p>Managing bills and paying bills is probably not the most looked forward to activity ever month, but it is a necessary one for many people. I wanted to give as many people access to a financial app as possible. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjLrpzg_6r0AhUymnIEHfzMBXUQFnoECBsQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fbills-io-track-your-expenses%2Fid1499730119&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qqFXmvp1JdMuBBHaREH47">Bills io</a> is free with an option to upgrade to some more advanced management features. If someone wants to better themselves financially and take that first step in organizing their financial life, I didn&rsquo;t want a subscription to yet another app be the blocker on this path. So for that reason, a fully functional free to use app with no ads or distractions was my goal. If you do find <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjLrpzg_6r0AhUymnIEHfzMBXUQFnoECBsQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fbills-io-track-your-expenses%2Fid1499730119&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qqFXmvp1JdMuBBHaREH47">Bills io</a> has helped you in some way financial, it is always appreciated to buy the premium version or simply recommend it to your friends and family. Dropping a review in the App Store is another great free way to show support.</p>
<p>Thanks, and I hope this post gives some extra context behind the creation and concept of the app. Check back on the 1st year anniversary on Dec. 29th for the first yearly overview! 🎉</p>

Overall, it was a typical hardware announcement event. I was impressed with how many colors they added to the new iMac. The interesting fact that the M1 processor remained the M1 and didn&amp;rsquo;t increment yet for the iMac means we will be waiting for M2 with the Pro devices.

Overall, it was a typical hardware announcement event. I was impressed with how many colors they added to the new iMac. The interesting fact that the M1 processor remained the M1 and didn&rsquo;t increment yet for the iMac means we will be waiting for M2 with the Pro devices.</p>
<p>Speaking of Pro, the iPad Pro update was simultaneously bland yet the most interesting read after the fact. Hardware-wise, it is the same look. Inside though, adding an M1 chip, Thunderbolt, AND up to 16gb of ram. This didn&rsquo;t hit me at first, but in my opinion, WWDC is going to bring MAJOR iPadOS changes. Typically, Apple bumps iPad hardware in the spring and matches the OS in the summer. Everything is adding up for this year to bring some sort of new windows manager for external displays. These iPads are getting too powerful not to have more productivity options. At the time of writing, I would love to trade in a MacBook Air to get an iPad Pro with a caveat. It would have to either virtualize macOS and output it to a monitor while docked, or it would have to have a desktop like windows manager. I would wager on the latter, and I believe it will be coming as a preview for WWDC. This could really be a game-changing device for portability and productivity. Fingers crossed on this.</p>
<p>Finally, the other minor things that were announced were AirTags and Apple TV. AirTags, simple, find your stuff. It&rsquo;s a tile. The Apple TV also got nice improvements, processor bump, and a new remote. All good updates, took too long, but good. Out of all the announcements, this is what I will be picking up.</p>

Thinking about how I wanted to develop this blog was not an easy task. My first instinct was to purchase a monthly subscription to <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost Blog</a>. At the time, the lowest subscription was about $30 / month billed annually. For a casual blog with no revenue, this was way too expensive.</p>
<p>I started to branch out and look at alternatives or self hosting. Diving deeper about self hosting, preserving content, and managing backups just seemed like extra work for little return. I am a single developer just wanting to publish some articles in Markdown when the mood strikes.</p>
<p>Free is an adequate price.</p>
<p>I knew GitHub Pages were a possibility, but really I didn&rsquo;t enjoy their default offering, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a>. It seemed a bit too messy with the rigid config and ruby base. There is nothing wrong with ruby, just something I never worked with. For the last few years, GoLang has been my main language.</p>
<p>Then I found <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why-hugo">Why Hugo</h2>
<p><a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> offered something very compelling, a theme-able, structured, static, markdown based website creator. This along with GitHub actions and pages, a quick and backed up blog could be hosted for free.</p>
<h2 id="stack">Stack</h2>
<p>You can read more about the content structure <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/organization/">here</a>, I&rsquo;m also still learning&hellip; Basically the stack is as follows:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This stack gives a powerful yet stress free blogging platform. Is it a bit technical? Sure, but the core concept of taking a markdown file and publishing it to a platform you control is worth it.</p>
<p>You can view the <a href="https://github.com/studioember/website">source code</a> to see how this site is laid out. Keep in mind that the root of the project is not the <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> source. I placed everything in <code>/site</code> to leave room for CI/CD scripts in the root.</p>
<h2 id="how-to">How To</h2>
<p>First <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/">install Hugo</a> using whichever platform that is appropriate. A simple <code>brew install hugo</code> on macOS did the trick for me.</p>
<p>Next, generate a new project by using <code>hugo new site example</code>. This will generate a base site with no content. At this point you can <code>cd example</code> and run <code>hugo server</code> to see your site at <a href="http://localhost:1313">localhost:1313</a>. It will be blank.</p>
<p>After that, browse and find a theme you like to get started. <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> offers a bunch <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io">available here</a>. When you find a theme, just follow the theme&rsquo;s README to install.</p>
<p>For this site, I used <a href="https://github.com/mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis">anubis</a>. The installation was pretty standard <a href="https://github.com/mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis#installation">here</a>. You can use git submodules, or simply download and extract the theme in the <code>themes/</code> directory.</p>
<p>Finally, add a markdown file in <code>content/</code> and configure you <code>config.yaml|.toml|.json</code> file. This did get me, yes the config file can be in 3 different formats, all are valid. Just pay attention you are not inserting <code>TOML</code> into a <code>YAML</code> config. Your site should auto refresh at <a href="http://localhost:1313">localhost:1313</a> now.</p>
<h2 id="hosting">Hosting</h2>
<p>A lot of this was taken care of with <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/hugo-setup">this Hugo GitHub Pages Action</a>:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will go through and generate a new branch called <code>gh-pages</code> with all of the static website content in it. I was a bit confused on why this happened, but apparently GitHub does not have artifacts like GitLab so a new branch is necessary for hosting.</p>
<p>Configure your <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site">GitHub Pages</a> with the correct branch, in this case <code>gh-pages</code>, and you are all set for a <code>$USERNAME.github.io page</code>.</p>
<p>Setting up a custom domain is a bit more work, but <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">GitHub&rsquo;s Documentation</a> provides some insight.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This was a quick way to get up and running with a blog that is fully version controlled and hosted for free. Hopefully, this helps shed some light on some initial issues you have getting hosting all set up.</p>
<p>Cheers 🍻</p>

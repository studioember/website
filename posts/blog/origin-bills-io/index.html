Prior to creating this app, I used to use apps like <a href=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205890>Reminders</a>, <a href=https://todoist.com>Todoist</a>, <a href=https://culturedcode.com/things/>Things</a>, <a href=https://www.apple.com/numbers/>Numbers</a>, etc. to try and create a system for remembering which bills to pay and when. In this process, I was able to create a system, but no app fit that payment flow. I decided that I had enough with the other apps, and I wanted an app that was dedicated to managing bills. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjLrpzg_6r0AhUymnIEHfzMBXUQFnoECBsQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fbills-io-track-your-expenses%2Fid1499730119&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qqFXmvp1JdMuBBHaREH47">Bills io</a> was formed.</p><p>The system that made it into the app took a few days of planning in a massive Numbers spreadsheet compiling every single expense I had and where it came from. I wanted to replicate the flow of money from the payee to the bill&rsquo;s payment portal. Many apps have tracking expenses down, but I wanted more. I wanted to know how much my rotating credit card balance would be every month because all my subscriptions are on that card. Managing recurring expenses was my primary focus from the beginning and continues to be a core component in the app.</p><p>Keeping a predictable and logical flow for managing finances is not easy. Everyone has different bills, and they probably have various methods of managing them. I wanted to have <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjLrpzg_6r0AhUymnIEHfzMBXUQFnoECBsQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fbills-io-track-your-expenses%2Fid1499730119&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qqFXmvp1JdMuBBHaREH47">Bills io</a> fill in the gap between an overly rigid budget system (<a href=https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/nerdwallet-budget-calculator>50 - 30 - 20 rule</a> for example) that tracks every single expense and an overly simplified one that just accounts for a list of bills in a month (think putting bills in the <a href=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205890>Reminders</a> app). My financial strategy is to have all my bills organized into lists based on accounts and to have a running counter of how much per month I owe in expenses (always a good number to know). This is basically the hybrid system I created for the app. I didn&rsquo;t want to bog down a new user with heavy financial management tools, but at the same time, wanted to guide them into the system I use every month. If they don&rsquo;t like the core idea, that is fine, everyone is different. There are other apps or services that might fit their need, but I don&rsquo;t want to break the core system that is used. Instead, I hope to grow and evolve it with more and more features down the road.</p><p>Managing bills and paying bills is probably not the most looked forward to activity ever month, but it is a necessary one for many people. I wanted to give as many people access to a financial app as possible. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjLrpzg_6r0AhUymnIEHfzMBXUQFnoECBsQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fbills-io-track-your-expenses%2Fid1499730119&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qqFXmvp1JdMuBBHaREH47">Bills io</a> is free with an option to upgrade to some more advanced management features. If someone wants to better themselves financially and take that first step in organizing their financial life, I didn&rsquo;t want a subscription to yet another app be the blocker on this path. So for that reason, a fully functional free to use app with no ads or distractions was my goal. If you do find <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjLrpzg_6r0AhUymnIEHfzMBXUQFnoECBsQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fbills-io-track-your-expenses%2Fid1499730119&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qqFXmvp1JdMuBBHaREH47">Bills io</a> has helped you in some way financial, it is always appreciated to buy the premium version or simply recommend it to your friends and family. Dropping a review in the App Store is another great free way to show support.</p><p>Thanks, and I hope this post gives some extra context behind the creation and concept of the app. Check back on the 1st year anniversary on Dec. 29th for the first yearly overview! ðŸŽ‰</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=https://studioember.com/tags/ios/>ios</a></span>

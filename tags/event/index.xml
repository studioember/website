Overall, it was a typical hardware announcement event. I was impressed with how many colors they added to the new iMac. The interesting fact that the M1 processor remained the M1 and didn&amp;rsquo;t increment yet for the iMac means we will be waiting for M2 with the Pro devices.
Speaking of Pro, the iPad Pro update was simultaneously bland yet the most interesting read after the fact.</description></item></channel></rss>

curl https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.keys &amp;gt;&amp;gt; $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys When working on server or connecting to remote hosts, having ssh access is vital. It took me by surprise that GitHub and GitLab both host these pages for public ssh keys. This makes it super easy to access for times when you cannot paste into a remote server.
I also use this to add keys for co-workers or sending the above tldr; to a client to add my keys.</description></item></channel></rss>

This update includes a complete Data syncing update to bring live refreshing data across all views. Future versions will use this for better multi-window support on macOS and iPadOS. The app has also been fully translated into Spanish and includes support for local currency display. Filtering is improved with additional filters to better break down lists of Bills.

A lot of stuff "under the hood", but necessary for upcoming changes.

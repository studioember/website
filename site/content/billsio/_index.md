# Overview

Bills io keeps track and notifies you about your expenses (Bills). Easily store and track your bills between devices (iPhone, iPad, and Mac). Bills io uses Apple's built in syncing via iCloud so your data stays with you in your iCloud account. Really, there is no 3rd party looking into the Bills you add in the app.

Everything is processed on device, and none of your data is sold to analytics companies. Bills io takes privacy as a first principle for all current and upcoming features.

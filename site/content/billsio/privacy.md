## Bills io

Studio Ember LLC is the organized company behind Bills io. Bills io is an independent application created and developed by Nathan Grey.

Bills io was built from the ground up with privacy in mind. Studio Ember LLC (may be referred to as we) does not own or operate any servers or databases for the use of Bills io. The app was built using CloudKit and native Apple iCloud frameworks to ensure User Data stays with the user.

Studio Ember cannot see any bills or accounts created in the app. We do not use any login system and sync data solely through iCloud. For instance, if you delete data in the app, we cannot help you recover it, because we do not host it.

Purchases are handled by [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/) ([privacy policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy)). The SDK is set to use anonymous user ids and is not configured for anything else besides handling purchases and subscriptions.

In terms of analytics and user interaction recording, we **DO NOT** include any analytics sdk and have no plans to in the future. If you have an issue, [email us](mailto:contact@studioember.com) or submit a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/studioember/billsio.app/issues/new) with information you are willing to share.

Below are the included 3rd party frameworks for review.

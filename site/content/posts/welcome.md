Thanks for visiting my personal blog. My name is Nathan Grey and I am the principal developer at [InnovoEdge](https://innovoedge.com) specializing in all things [containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io). In my free time, I develop [Bills io](https://billsio.app), an entirely [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) based personal finance application for iPhone, iPad, and macOS.

This blog will focus primarily in my adventures in containerization, orchestration, SwiftUI, productivity, apps, development environments, general computer use, and other areas that interest me. Be sure to follow along with the tags that interest you.

Anything with [#tutorial](/categories/tutorial/) will rely heavily on code snippets, images, videos, and breakdowns to illustrate the concepts. The first [#tutorial](/categories/tutorial/) will focus on beginning this blog from scratch and taking you through every step for deploying a containerized blog with [Ghost Blog](https://ghost.org).

Glad you decided to stop by ðŸ˜€

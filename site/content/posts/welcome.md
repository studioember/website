Thanks for visiting [StudioEmber](https://studioember.com). My name is [Nathan Grey](https://github.com/overtfuture) and I am a developer at [InnovoEdge](https://innovoedge.com) specializing in all things [containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io). In my free time, I develop [Bills io](https://billsio.app), an entirely [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) personal finance application for iPhone, iPad, and macOS.

This blog will focus primarily in my adventures in containerization, orchestration, SwiftUI, productivity, apps, development environments, general computer use, and other areas of life that interest me. Be sure to follow along with the tags that interest you.

Anything categorized under [tutorials](/categories/tutorials/) will rely heavily on code snippets, images, videos, and breakdowns to illustrate the concepts. The first guide in [tutorials](/categories/tutorials/) will focus on beginning this blog from scratch and taking you through every step for deploying a containerized blog with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

Be sure to come back later for new content and recommendations.

Glad you decided to stop by ðŸ˜€

My name is Nathan Grey and I am a developer at InnovoEdge specializing in all things containers and Kubernetes. In my free time, I develop Bills io, an entirely SwiftUI personal finance application for iPhone, iPad, and macOS.
This blog will focus primarily in my adventures in containerization, orchestration, SwiftUI, productivity, apps, development environments, general computer use, and other areas of life that interest me. Be sure to follow along with the tags that interest you.</description></item></channel></rss>
